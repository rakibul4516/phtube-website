            <p class="text-lg text-justify">var,let and const keyword is used for variable declaration.But variables declared with var,let and const based on different conditions.JavaScript has two main types of scope."Global scope" and "Block-level scope"."var" is a global scope variable on the other hand "let" and "const" is block-level scope variable.Here is the explain bellow:
                <br>
                <br>
                Var:- "var" is a global scope variable.The global scope are accessible from anywhere in JavaScript code.If we declare a "var" variable outside of any function or block of code, it becomes a global variable.It is accessible from anywhere in your JavaScript code.We can reassign the value of this variable.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let:- "let" is block-level scope, which means it is accessible into the nearest enclosing block. The block can be a function, an if else statement, a loop, or any other code block enclosed by curly braces { }.Value of this variable can reassigned and also can apply function for remove or add values.
                <br>
                <br>
                Const:- Variables declared with "const" are block-scoped, only accessible within the block in which we are defined. The block can be a function, conditional statement, a loop, or any other code block enclosed by curly braces { } like 'let'.'const' are constant, which means values cannot be reassigned after initialized. Once assign a value to a const variable,cannot change that value.But we can apply function for remove or add values.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl py-5 border-b ">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify">"null" and "undefined" both used to represent the absence of a value.Both are premitive data type.But "null" assigned as typeof object and "undefined" assigned as typeof undefined.Here are differences between them:
                <br>
                <br>
                null:- "null" is a special value for absence of any object value. It is a primitive data type."null" is type of object. When we declare a variable to assign a object but there is no value we can assign "null".We can use "null" as a global and block-level variable object value,as a perameter value of function,as a condition and object properties value etc. for example: let myVariable = null;
                <br>
                <br>
                undefined:-"undefined" is a special value that is automatically assigned to variables or properties.which variable or properties declared but not assigned any value."undefined" is primitive type data . But is's typeof undefined.We can use "undefined" as a global and block-level variable value,as a perameter value of function,as a condition etc.For example: let myVariable;</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-justify">REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations.It's used to communicate between clients and servers.Resources are represented in different formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).Clients request to server for get data.If server has the data and request is right server will provide desired data other wise server will return an error message.REST APIs separates the client and server side for increse  scalability and flexibility.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most common HTTP methods used in REST APIs are:
            <ul class="pl-5 text-lg">
                <li>GET: GET used for read-only operations.</li>
                <li>POST: Create a new resource.</li>
                <li>PATCH: Partially update a resource.</li>
                <li>PUT: Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist.</li>
                <li>DELETE: Remove a resource.</li>
                <li>HEAD:  HEAD request to a URL for headers containing information.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
